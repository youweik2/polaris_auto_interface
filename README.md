# Guidance and Control for Polaris GEM car at UIUC Highbay

This repository provides guidance for autonomous driving development on the Polaris GEM series vehicles at the UIUC Highbay. It includes a brief introduction to the GEM car and an overview of the implemented control framework. The system is tailored for the GEM e4 and can be adapted to the e2 with minor modifications.

# Gem Car Info

Home Page: https://publish.illinois.edu/robotics-autonomy-resources/

We mainly use the GEM e2 and e4 vehicles at Highbay. For details, contact John at jmhart3@illinois.edu. Highbay provides a pre-configured Ubuntu 20.04 system for direct vehicle use, and you can ask the administrator to help copy the SSD. We also have an ACRL SSD with our custom setup that is ready to use. It is stored together with the car keys, and John can help you locate it. Please note that some vehicle hardware has changed, so make sure to follow the latest updates.

# Requirements for Real Vehicle Testing

We should reserve the time slot by using the link: https://robotics.illinois.edu/reserve-lab/

After logging into your Illinois account, you can request training on the Highbay reservation website or contact John directly to schedule it. Training is required before participating in vehicle testing. Each test must involve at least two people: one driver and one observer. Both roles require completing the training, which includes safety procedures, observer duties, and driving. To serve as a driver, you must also pass a short driving test. Make sure your lab safety certifications are updated on the universityâ€™s website. Once training is completed, you can use the vehicle during your reserved time slot.
