# Guidance and Control for Polaris GEM car at UIUC Highbay

This repository provides guidance for autonomous driving development on the Polaris GEM series vehicles at the UIUC Highbay. It includes a brief introduction to the GEM car and an overview of the implemented control framework. The system is tailored for the GEM e4 and can be adapted to the e2 with minor modifications.

We mainly use the GEM e2 and e4 vehicles at Highbay. For more information, you can contact John at jmhart3@illinois.edu.

The facility provides a pre-configured Ubuntu 20.04 system for direct vehicle useâ€”ask the administrator to help you copy the SSD.

Alternatively, you can use the ACRL SSD with our custom setup. John can help locate it.

Please note that some vehicle hardware has been updated, so make sure to follow the latest changes.
